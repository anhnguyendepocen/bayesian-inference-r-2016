# bayesian-inference-r-2016
Notes and code for presentation to PDX R meetup Sept 21, 2016 on Bayesian inference in R.

The presentation is: bayesian-inference-r-2016.html

The presentation is composed with [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com);
after cloning this repo,
you can just point your browser to file:///path/to/bayesian-inference-r-2016.html,
but you'll need an Internet connection to use Remark,
as it wants to download fonts and MathJax.

Feel free to post questions or comments as issues on this project,
or just email me: robert.dodier@gmail.com
